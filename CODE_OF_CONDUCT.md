# Code of Conduct

Welcome to the repository! :tada:
We aim to provide and encourage a welcoming, friendly and positive environment for _everyone_.

This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for participation within this repository, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behaviour.
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect this Code of Conduct to be honoured.
Anyone found to be in violation of this Code may be asked to leave the community.

## Our goals

- **Be friendly and patient**
- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a a community that welcomes and supports people of _all_ backgrounds and identitites.
- **Be considerate**: Your work may be used by other people, and you in turn may depend on the work of others.
  Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- **Be respectful**: Not all of us agree all the time but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and/or poor manners.
  It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
- **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of professionals and conduct ourselves professionally.
  Be kind to others.
  Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour _of any kind_ are not acceptable _under any circumstances_.
- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Diagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time.
  It is important we resolve these constructively.
  Diversity contributes to the strength of our community as different people have different perspectives on issues.

If you witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting Sarah Gibson ([drsarahlgibson[at]gmail.com](mailto:drsarahlgibson@gmail.com)).
